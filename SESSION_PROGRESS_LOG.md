# Session Progress Log - SACD Lab TUI

This file tracks session-by-session progress, regressions, and current status for the SACD Lab TUI project. This file MUST be updated at the start and end of every development session.

## Instructions for Claude

**MANDATORY HABITS:**
1. **ALWAYS read PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md at the start of every session** - This is your lodestar
2. **ALWAYS update this SESSION_PROGRESS_LOG.md** when making changes
3. **NEVER make assumptions** about current state - verify against PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md
4. **UPDATE both files** when completing tasks or discovering issues
