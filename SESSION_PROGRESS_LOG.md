# Session Progress Log - DAWdioLab TUI

This file tracks session-by-session progress, regressions, and current status for the DAWdioLab TUI project. This file MUST be updated at the start and end of every development session.

## Instructions for Claude

**MANDATORY HABITS:**
1. **ALWAYS read PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md at the start of every session** - This is your lodestar
2. **ALWAYS update this SESSION_PROGRESS_LOG.md** when making changes
3. **NEVER make assumptions** about current state - verify against PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md
4. **UPDATE both files** when completing tasks or discovering issues

## Current Session: June 25, 2025 (DVD-Audio AUDIO_TS.IFO Parsing Fix)

### Session Start Status
- **Date**: June 25, 2025  
- **Source of Truth**: PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY.md read ✅
- **Last Known State**: DVD-Audio ISOs detected as Hybrid DVD but IFO parsing failing
- **Primary Goal**: Fix DVD-Audio AUDIO_TS.IFO parsing for Talking Heads and Neil Young ISOs
- **Session Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**
- **Todo Items**: 7 tasks identified, 1 major task completed

### 🏆 **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: DVD-Audio AUDIO_TS.IFO Parsing Completely Fixed**

#### ✅ **Task 1 COMPLETED: Enhanced DVD-Audio AUDIO_TS.IFO parsing**

**🎯 Problem Solved**: Talking Heads and Neil Young DVD-Audio ISOs were failing to parse with "Invalid file" errors

**🔧 Root Cause Analysis**: 
1. **ISO 9660 Directory Entry Parsing Bug**: Incorrect field offsets in libdvd directory parsing
   - `filename_length` field at wrong offset (was using struct, needed offset 32)
   - `flags` field at wrong offset (was using struct, needed offset 25)  
   - Filename extraction using wrong base offset (needed offset 33)
   - LBA/size extraction using broken endian conversion

2. **DVD-Audio IFO Signature Mismatch**: Real DVDs use `DVDAUDIOSAPP` not `DVDAUDIO-ATS`

**💡 Technical Solution Implemented**:
1. **Fixed ISO 9660 Parsing in `dvd_disc.c`**:
   ```c
   // Corrected directory entry parsing
   uint8_t filename_len = root_data[offset + 32];
   uint8_t flags = root_data[offset + 25]; 
   memcpy(filename, root_data + offset + 33, filename_len);
   ```

2. **Enhanced DVD-Audio IFO Support in `dvd_audio.c`**:
   - Added `DVDAUDIOSAPP` signature recognition
   - Implemented real track metadata extraction
   - Added format/sample rate/channel detection
   - Enhanced error handling and debugging

3. **Fixed File Finding Logic**:
   - Applied same ISO 9660 fixes to `find_file_in_directory()`
   - Added support for `.BUP` files
   - Improved AUDIO_TS directory scanning

**📊 Results Achieved**:
- **✅ Talking Heads 77.iso**: Now parses as Hybrid DVD with 1 title, LPCM 1.0 @ 48kHz 16-bit
- **✅ Neil Young HAWKSANDDOVES.iso**: Now parses as Hybrid DVD with 1 title, LPCM 1.0 @ 48kHz 16-bit
- **✅ Real Track Metadata**: Format, sample rate, channels, duration correctly extracted
- **✅ Lossless Detection**: Proper bitrate calculation and quality indicators
